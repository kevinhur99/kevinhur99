Hello, my name is Kevin Hur. 

I am a Computer Science major at Northeastern University. 
I was originally a Computer Science and Computer Engineer major, but changed to just Computer Science as I found programming more fun for me. 
Specifically, I enjoy developing and testing software. 

As for my free time, I also enjoy drawing and playing the piano.
